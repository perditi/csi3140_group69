# Design System Document
This document is to outline the design system for lab 4 "Yatzy"

## Fonts
* None

## Colours
* White #FFFFFF

## Dice
* Random number generator, no feel.

## Components
* Only the game's barest mechanic (dice-rolling and score-keeping) was implemented as allowed by lab instruction, so there are otherwise none.
