/* You will expose the Yatzy game functionality through a JSON API, 
and update your JavaScript to make AJAX calls to your newly created API.
All game state should be stored on the PHP server (you can store that information 
in the PHP $_SESSION) and your HTML/CSS/JavaScript should focus on displaying the current 
state of the game (the JavaScript should NOT calculate scores or track progress, just display the current state).

You will track a game leaderboard showing your top 10 scores. For simplicity, this information 
can also be stored in the PHP $_SESSION. */
